Abstract

We present a method for automatic
categorization of author gender via
n-gram analysis. Using a corpus
of British student essays, experi-
ments using character-level, word-
level, and part-of-speech n-grams are
performed. The peak accuracy for all
methods is roughly equal, reaching a
maximum of 81%. These results are
on par with other, established tech-
niques, while retaining the simplicity
and ease-of-generalization inherent in
n-gram techniques.
