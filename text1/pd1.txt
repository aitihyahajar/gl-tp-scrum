Abstract—This paper presents techniques for speech-to-text
and speech-to-speech automatic summarization based on speech
unit extraction and concatenation. For the former case, a
two-stage summarization method consisting of important sentence
extraction and word-based sentence compaction is investigated.
Sentence and word units which maximize the weighted sum of
linguistic likelihood, amount of information, confidence measure,
and grammatical likelihood of concatenated units are extracted
from the speech recognition results and concatenated for pro-
ducing summaries. For the latter case, sentences, words, and
between-filler units are investigated as units to be extracted from
original speech. These methods are applied to the summarization
of unrestricted-domain spontaneous presentations and evaluated
by objective and subjective measures. It was confirmed that pro-
posed methods are effective in spontaneous speech summarization.

Index Terms—Presentation, speech recognition, speech summa-

rization, speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, spontaneous speech.
